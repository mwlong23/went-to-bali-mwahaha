#### By _**by Mitch Long**_

## Description

_This independent project was used to simulate a situation where a developer inherits a project that was left with poor documentation and missing key features.  The objective was to fix broken features and improve the site functionality using AJAX. I chose to fix these six broken features:_


* _Allow other than whole dollar amounts for admin product creation (for instance, 3.99)._
* _Ensure that users can't order a negative number of items._
* _Add flash messages for signing up, signing in and signing out._
* _Add product update and delete functionality for admins._
* _Add product validations._
* _Add admin flash messages for adding, updating and deleting products._


## Known Bugs

_Product cards are not aligned, content overflows from each section_
